# Using CLP in Third-Generation Programming Languages

## About the Project

This repository contains the graduation thesis that explores the application and implementation of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) within third-generation programming languages. The research examines how CLP paradigms can be integrated into conventional programming languages to solve complex computational problems more efficiently.

## Abstract

Constraint Logic Programming represents a powerful declarative programming paradigm that combines the logical inference capabilities of logic programming with constraint solving techniques. This thesis investigates how CLP can be effectively utilized within third-generation programming languages, analyzing both theoretical foundations and practical implementations.

The work examines:
- Fundamental concepts of Constraint Logic Programming
- Integration strategies for CLP in third-generation languages
- Practical applications and use cases
- Performance analysis and optimization techniques
- Comparative studies with traditional programming approaches

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:
